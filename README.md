Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed a project for the *Fast Finder Search Bar Hackathon* by *Innomatics Research Labs*! ðŸŽ‰

I developed a sleek search bar that allows users to search for countries by name or capital, with real-time suggestions and data from a JSON dataset. Built using *React* and styled with *CSS* (or frameworks like *Bootstrap/Tailwind), I deployed the live demo via **Netlify/Vercel*.

I gained valuable experience in *React, creating responsive interfaces, and deploying on **Netlify/Vercel. Thanks to **Innomatics Research Labs* for the opportunity! ðŸ”— [Live Demo](#)
